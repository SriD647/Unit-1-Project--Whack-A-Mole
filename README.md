# WHACK-A-MOLE

# **Welcome to Whack-A-Mole**

## **Game description**
Your lawn has been swarmed by hungry moles and the only way to get rid of them is to use a mallet and start whackin! The game board is designed to look like a section of your lawn. It has has 9 evenly sized circles in the center, from which the moles will appear and disappear at random in less than a split second. The objective of the game is for the player to whack at least 10 moles with the mallet before the 10 second countdown ends. A message will appear at the end of the round to indicate whether the player has won or lost. The game board also consists of a start button (to start a round), a reset button (to reset the game), a score board (to display current score), a timer (to show the time remaining in the round), and a cursor with the image of a mallet (used to whack the moles). There is also three buttons (easy, medium, and hard)
to be able to choose different levels of difficulties.

## **Getting started-Important details**
* In order to start a round, please choose the level of choice (easy, medium, or hard) before clicking start.
* After a round has completed, the reset button must be clicked before the start button to initiate a new round. 
* Clicking a mole multiple times before it can switch positions will not count. The system will only count the first click.

# WHACK-A-MOLE

# **Welcome to Whack-A-Mole**

## **Game description**
Your lawn has been swarmed by hungry moles who keep squeeking all day! The only way to save your lawn and your peace of mind is to pick up a mallet and start whackin! The game board is designed to look like a section of your lawn. It has has 9 evenly sized circles in the center, from which the moles will appear and disappear at random in less than a split second. The objective of the game is for the player to whack at least a sufficient amount of moles with the mallet before the countdown ends. A message will appear at the end of the round to indicate whether the player has won or lost. The game board also consists of a start button (to start a round), a reset button (to reset the game), a score board (to display current score), a timer (to show the time remaining in the round), and a cursor with the image of a mallet (used to whack the moles). 

There is also three buttons (easy, medium, and hard) to be able to choose from different levels of difficulties. These levels determine the length of the round, the speed of the mole appears, and how many moles need to be whacked. The harder the round, the greater is the speed of the mole, the lower the length of the round, and the greater is the points required.

## **Getting started-Important details**
* In order to start a round, please choose the level of dfficulty (easy, medium, or hard) before clicking start.
* After a round has completed, the reset button must be clicked before the start button to initiate a new round. 
* Clicking a mole multiple times before it can switch positions will not count. The system will only count the first click.
* For the best experience, aim the mallet at the top of the mole's head. 
* If your aim was correct, a sound effect of a hammer hitting will play. If it doesn't, it means the mallet did not properly hit the mole.
* Google Chrome browser is recommended.

# WHACK-A-MOLE

# **Welcome to Whack-A-Mole**

## **Game description**
Your lawn has been swarmed by annoying moles who keep squeeking all day! The only way to save your lawn and your peace of mind is to pick up a mallet and start whackin! 

The game board is designed to look like a section of your lawn. It has has 9 evenly sized circles in the center, from which the moles will appear and disappear at random. The objective of the game is for the player to whack at least a sufficient amount of moles with the mallet before the 15 second round countdown ends. A message will appear at the end of the round to indicate whether the player has won or lost. The game board also consists of a start button (to start a round), a reset button (to reset the game), a score board (to display current score), a timer (to show the time remaining in the round), a cursor with the image of a mallet (used to whack the moles), and a background image of grass. 

There is also three buttons (easy, medium, and hard) to be able to choose from 3 different levels of difficulties. These levels determine the speed the mole appears and how many moles the player must whack to win the round. The harder the round, the greater is the speed of the mole and the greater is the number of points required to win. Every round regardless of difficulty is 15 seconds long. Refer to the following for a breakdown of each diffculty level:

***Easy*** <br>
Mole speed:           2 seconds<br>
Points needed to win: 5 moles <br>

***Medium*** <br>
Mole speed:           750 milliseconds<br>
Points needed to win: 12 moles <br>


***Hard*** <br>
Mole speed:           550 milliseconds<br>
Points needed to win: 16 moles <br>


* Once a round is completed, the welcome header will change to the outcome of the game. It will inform the user if they won or lost. Also, both win or lose outcomes have their own unqiue audioclips to inform the user.

* In order to start a round, please choose the level of dfficulty (easy, medium, or hard) before clicking start.
* After a round has completed, the reset button must be clicked, before choosing the difficulty and pressing the start button to initiate a new round. 
* Clicking a mole multiple times before it can switch positions will not count. The system will only count the first click.
* For the best experience, aim the mallet at the top of the mole's head.
* Please keep audio volume to at least 50% in order to hear the audio and sound effects in the game. 
* If your aim was correct, a sound effect of a hammer hitting will play. If it doesn't, it means the mallet did not properly hit the mole.
* Google Chrome browser is recommended.

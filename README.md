# WHACK-A-MOLE

# **Welcome to Whack-A-Mole**

## **Game description**
Your lawn has been swarmed by hungry moles and the only way to get rid of them is to use a mallet and start whackin! The game board is designed to look like a section of your lawn. It has has 9 evenly sized circles in the center, from which the moles will appear and disappear at random in less than a split second. The objective of the game is for the player to whack at least 13 moles with the mallet before the 10 second countdown ends. A message will appear at the end of the round to indicate whether the player has won or lost. The game board also consists of a start button (to start a round), a reset button (to reset the game), a score board (to display current score), a timer (to show the time remaining in the round), and cursor with the image of a mallet (used to whack the moles).
